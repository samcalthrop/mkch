# mk.ch
> an app for quick & easy construction of markov chains for simulation

## the plan

- app built with tauri
- custom [`.ch`/`.mkv`/`.mkch`] file extension used to find chains (research which of these file extensions works best), where chains are markov chains created by the user for simulation
- MINIMAL
