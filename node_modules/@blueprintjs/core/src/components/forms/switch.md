@# Switch

**Switch** is a form control for toggling between boolean states. It is similar to
[**Checkbox**](#core/components/checkbox), but presents a more skeuomorphic appearance that mimics a physical switch.

Its whole label is interactive and it supports a few visual modifiers for different UI layouts.
