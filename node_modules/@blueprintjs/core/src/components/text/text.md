@# Text

The **Text** component adds accessible overflow behavior to a line of text by conditionally adding the title attribute
and truncating with an ellipsis when content overflows its container.

@## Import

```tsx
import { Text } from "@blueprintjs/core";
```

@reactExample TextExample

@## Props interface

**Text** accepts and renders arbitrary children. It is intended that these children render as text.
